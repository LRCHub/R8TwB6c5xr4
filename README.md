# Justin Bieber – GO BABY

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
That's my baby, she's iconic,
iPhone case, lip gloss on it
And, oh my days,
she keeps 'em talkin',
it's comedy, just block it,
oh, my baby
When sunlight turns to shadow
and it gets hard to face
Like water to a flower, babe,
I know you need the rain
Nothing needs to work out
and nothing needs to break
Don't need to pretend
that you're okay
So cry on my shoulder,
just turn into me
Cry on my shoulder
whenever you need it
You better believe it
that I can hold
all the weight and shrivel inside
So cry on my shoulder,
that low melody
Cry on my shoulder,
I know you'll breach me
Lay it all down
and I can love it away,
just stay by my side, oh
So go, baby, go, baby, go, baby
Go, baby, go, baby, go, uh
Just go, baby, go, baby, go, baby
Go, baby, go, baby, go, oh
Sunday to Sunday,
I'm here when you're weak
Coaster beside me,
it's always okay
Every moment,
you know where to find me
You don't have to speak,
I can read you (Ooh)
When sunlight turns to shadow
and it gets hard to face
Like water to a flower, babe,
I know you need the rain
Nothing needs to work out
and nothing needs to break
(Ah, ooh)
Don't need to pretend
that you're okay (Ah, ooh)
So cry on my shoulder,
just turn into me
Cry on my shoulder
whenever you need it
You better believe it that I can hold
all the weight and shrivel inside
So cry on my shoulder,
that low melody
Cry on my shoulder,
I know you'll breach me
Lay you down and I can love it away,
just stay by my side, oh
So go, baby, go, baby, go, baby
Go, baby, go, baby, go, uh
Just go, baby, go, baby, go, baby
Go, baby, go, baby, go, oh (Ooh)
What you cryin',
what you cryin' for? (Ooh)
What you cryin', what you cryin',
what you cryin' for? (Ooh)
What you cryin', what you cryin',
what you cryin' for? (Ooh)
What you cryin', what you cryin',
what you cryin' for? (Ooh, woah)
What you cryin' about? (Ooh, woah)
