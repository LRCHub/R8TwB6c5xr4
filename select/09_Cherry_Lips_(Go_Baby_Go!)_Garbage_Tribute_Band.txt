She gave you everything she had
But she was young and dumb
She'd just turned twenty-one
She didn't care to hang around
So when the shit came down
Why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing
That you had ever seen
You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms
With your cherry lips and golden curls
You could make grown men gasp
When you'd go walking past them
In your hot pants and high heels
Well, they could not believe
That such a body was for real
It seemed like rainbows would appear
Whenever you came near
The clouds would disappear
Because you looked just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash
And suddenly a spell was cast
You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms
You hold a candle in your heart
You shine the light on hidden parts
You make the whole world wanna dance
You bought yourself a second chance
Go baby, go go
We're right behind you
Go baby, go go
Yeah, we're looking at you
Go baby, go go
Aw, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Yeah, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Aw, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Yeah, we're looking at you
Go baby, go baby
Aw, we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby
Yeah, we're looking at you
You hold a candle in your heart
Go baby, go go
You shine the light on hidden parts
Go baby, go go
You make the whole world wanna dance
Go baby, go go
You bought yourself a second chance
Go baby, go baby, go
Delicate boy
Go baby, go baby, go
In the hysterical realm
Go baby, go baby, go
Of an emotional landslide
Go baby go baby go
In physical terms
Go baby, go go go
Yeah, we're looking at you
Go baby, go go
Aw, we're right behind you
